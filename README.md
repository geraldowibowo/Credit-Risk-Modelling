# Credit Risk Modelling
Doing credit analytics to predict whether or not a customer will be default

The dataset can be downloaded from:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/tq3xz0piqitnc59/loan_data_2007_2014.csv?dl=0

The preprocessing file will create a new 4 CSV file:
- 'loan_data_inputs_train.csv'
- 'loan_data_targets_train.csv'
- 'loan_data_inputs_test.csv'
- 'loan_data_targets_test.csv'

These 4 CSV files will be used in the Credit Risk Modelling Python code

Next, do the 'credit risk modelling - probability of default' file to make a model to predict whether or not a customer will be default and create scorecards and see the approval and rejection ratio
This file will create another two CSV file:
- 'inputs_train_with_ref_cat.csv'
- 'df_scorecard.csv'


Lastly, do the 'Credit Risk Modelling - Monitoring' filw in order to see analyze the population stability index (PSI).
The dataset for this file can be downloaded from:
